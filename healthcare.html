                    Health care has seen some amazing advances with the progression of artificial 
                    intelligence and robotics. With sophisticated algorithms to diagnose disease or 
                    predict health outcomes, patients can have more accuracy and security in 
                    their medical care. 
                    <br>
                    Hospital care can also be improved using AI. Care taking robots can now 
                    keep tabs on patients who may need quick response time if something goes wrong.
