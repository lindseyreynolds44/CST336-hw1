                    It is estimated that $2.6 billion is spent on drug development, but a large 
                    amount of that money is essentially wasted since 9 out of 10 drugs never make 
                    it to market.  
                    <br>
                    Researchers developing new medicines are now able to use robots in order to 
                    analyze billions of data points, in order to predict and prove hypotheses. 
                    This saves both money and time.

                        “We are turning the drug-discovery paradigm upside down by using patient-driven 
                        biology and data to derive more-predictive hypotheses, rather than the traditional 
                        trial-and-error approach,”
